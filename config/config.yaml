# CODE EXPLANATION:
# 1. Centralized Configuration:
#    - Hardcoding paths (like "C:/Users/Name/...") is bad practice.
#    - We use this YAML file to define relative paths ("gnn_model.pth").
#    - If we move the project to the Cloud, we only change this file, not the Python code.
# 2. Model Parameters:
#    - 'hidden_channels: 64' ensures the frontend matches the architecture the model was trained with.
